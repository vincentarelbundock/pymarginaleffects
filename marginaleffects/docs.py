Plot {x} on the y-axis against values of one or more predictors (x-axis, colors/shapes, and facets).

The `by` argument is used to plot marginal {x}, that is, {x} made on the original data, but averaged
by subgroups. This is analogous to using the `by` argument in the `{x}()` function.

The `condition` argument is used to plot conditional {x}, that is, {x} made on a user-specified grid.
This is analogous to using the `newdata` argument and `datagrid()` function in a `{x}()` call.

All unspecified variables are held at their mean or mode. This includes grouping variables in mixed-effects models, so analysts who fit such models may want to specify the groups of interest using the `variables` argument, or supply model-specific arguments to compute population-level estimates.

- List[str] or str: List of variable names to compute {x}s for.

        * `None`: contrast between True and False
    - Numeric variables:
        * Numeric of length 1: Contrast for a gap of `x`, computed at the observed value plus and minus `x / 2`. For example, estimating a `+1` contrast compares adjusted predictions when the regressor is equal to its observed value minus 0.5 and its observed value plus 0.5.
        * Numeric of length equal to the number of rows in `newdata`: Same as above, but the contrast can be customized for each row of `newdata`.

        * "sd": Contrast across one standard deviation around the regressor mean.
        * "2sd": Contrast across two standard deviations around the regressor mean.
        * "minmax": Contrast between the maximum and the minimum values of the regressor.
