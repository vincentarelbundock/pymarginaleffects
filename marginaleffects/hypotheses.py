    (Non-)Linear Tests for Null Hypotheses, Joint Hypotheses, Equivalence, Non Superiority, and Non Inferiority.

    This function calculates uncertainty estimates as first-order approximate standard errors for linear or non-linear
    functions of a vector of random variables with known or estimated covariance matrix. It emulates the behavior of
    the excellent and well-established `car::deltaMethod` and `car::linearHypothesis` functions in R, but it supports
    more models; requires fewer dependencies; expands the range of tests to equivalence and superiority/inferiority;
    and offers convenience features like robust standard errors.

    Warning #1: Tests are conducted directly on the scale defined by the `type` argument. For some models, it can make
    sense to conduct hypothesis or equivalence tests on the `"link"` scale instead of the `"response"` scale which is
    often the default.

    Warning #2: For hypothesis tests on objects produced by the `marginaleffects` package, it is safer to use the
    `hypothesis` argument of the original function. Using `hypotheses()` may not work in certain environments, in lists,
    or when working programmatically with *apply style functions.

    Warning #3: The tests assume that the `hypothesis` expression is (approximately) normally distributed, which for
    non-linear functions of the parameters may not be realistic. More reliable confidence intervals can be obtained using
    the `inferences()` function with `method = "boot"`.

    Parameters:
    model : object
        Model object estimated by `statsmodels`
    hypothesis : str formula, int, float, numpy array or optional
        The null hypothesis value. Default is None.
    conf_level : float, optional
        Confidence level for the hypothesis test. Default is 0.95.
    vcov : bool, optional
        Whether to use the covariance matrix in the hypothesis test. Default is True.
    equivalence : tuple, optional
        The equivalence range for the hypothesis test. Default is None.

    Returns:
    MarginaleffectsDataFrame
        A DataFrame containing the results of the hypothesis tests.

    Examples:

        # When `hypothesis` is `None`, `hypotheses()` returns a DataFrame of parameters
        hypotheses(model)

        # A different null hypothesis
        hypotheses(model, hypothesis = 3)

        # Test of equality between coefficients
        hypotheses(model, hypothesis="param1 = param2")

        # Non-linear function
        hypotheses(model, hypothesis="exp(param1 + param2) = 0.1")

        # Robust standard errors
        hypotheses(model, hypothesis="param1 = param2", vcov="HC3")

        # Equivalence, non-inferiority, and non-superiority tests
        hypotheses(model, equivalence=(0, 10))
