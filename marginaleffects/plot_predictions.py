    """
    Plot predictions on the y-axis against values of one or more predictors (x-axis, colors, and facets).

    The `by` argument is used to plot marginal predictions, that is, predictions made on the original data,
    but averaged by subgroups. This is analogous to using the by argument in the `predictions()` function.
    The condition argument is used to plot conditional predictions, that is, predictions made on a
    user-specified grid. This is analogous to using the `newdata` argument and `datagrid()` function in a
    `predictions()` call.

    All unspecified variables are held at their mean or mode. This includes grouping variables in
    mixed-effects models, so analysts who fit such models may want to specify the groups of interest using
    the `variables` argument, or supply model-specific arguments to compute population-level estimates.
    See details below.

    Parameters
    ----------
    model : object
        Model object.

    condition : str, list, dictionary
        Max length : 3.
        1: x-axis. 2: color. 3: facets.
        list : Names of the predictors to display
            Numeric variables in position 1 is summarized by 100 numbers
            Numeric variables in positions 2 and 3 are summarized by Tukeyâ€™s five numbers
        dictionary : Keys correspond to predictors. Values are numeric vectors.
            - Series of lists of the same type as the original variable.
            - Numeric variables:
                - Series or list of numeric values.
                - String: "minmax", "threenum", "fivenum".

    by : bool, str, list
        Max length : 3.
        1: x-axis. 2: color. 3: facets.
        Names of the categorical predictors to marginalize across.

    newdata : dataframe
        When newdata is NULL, the grid is determined by the condition argument. When newdata is not NULL, the argument behaves in the same way as in the predictions() function.

    wts: Column name of weights to use for marginalization. Must be a column in `newdata`

    transform : Callable, optional
        A function applied to unit-level adjusted predictions and confidence intervals just before
        the function returns results, by default None.

    draw : True returns a matplotlib plot. False returns a dataframe of the underlying data.
